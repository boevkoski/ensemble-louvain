## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install elouvain.

```bash
pip install elouvain
```

## Usage

```python
from elouvain import ensemble_louvain
import networkx as nx

if __name__ == '__main__':
    G = nx.karate_club_graph() # create the well-known karate club network
    partition = ensemble_louvain.detect(G) # apply Ensemble Louvain on the graph
    partition[1] # get community label for node 1
```
